<h5 class="subsubsection">3.15.2.8 keywords</h5>

<!-- ?binary keywords -->
<p>The following keywords apply only when generating coordinates from binary
data files.  That is, the control mapping the individual elements of a binary
array, matrix, or image to specific x/y/z positions.

<p class="noindent">&mdash; SCAN &mdash;

<!-- ?binary keywords scan -->
   <p>A great deal of confusion can arise concerning the relationship between how
gnuplot scans a binary file and the dimensions seen on the plot.  To lessen
the confusion, conceptually think of gnuplot _always_ scanning the binary file
point/line/plane or fast/medium/slow.  Then this keyword is used to tell
gnuplot how to map this scanning convention to the Cartesian convention shown
in plots, i.e., x/y/z.  The qualifier for scan is a two or three letter code
representing where point is assigned (first letter), line is assigned (second
letter), and plane is assigned (third letter).  For example, `scan=yx` means
the fastest, point-by-point, increment should be mapped along the Cartesian
y dimension and the middle, line-by-line, increment should be mapped along the
x dimension.

   <p>When the plotting mode is `plot`, the qualifier code can include the two
letters x and y.  For `splot`, it can include the three letters x, y and z.

   <p>There is nothing restricting the inherent mapping from point/line/plane to
apply only to Cartesian coordinates.  For this reason there are cylindrical
coordinate synonyms for the qualifier codes where t (theta), r and z are
analogous to the x, y and z of Cartesian coordinates.

<p class="noindent">&mdash; TRANSPOSE &mdash;

<!-- ?binary keywords transpose -->
   <p>Shorthand notation for `scan=yx` or `scan=yxz`.

<p class="noindent">&mdash; DX, DY, DZ &mdash;

<!-- ?binary keywords dx -->
<!-- ?binary keywords dy -->
   <p><a name="index-dx-344"></a>
<a name="index-dy-345"></a>
When gnuplot generates coordinates, it uses the spacing described by these
keywords.  For example `dx=10 dy=20` would mean space samples along the
x dimension by 10 and space samples along the y dimension by 20.  `dy` cannot
appear if `dx` does not appear.  Similarly, `dz` cannot appear if `dy` does not
appear.  If the underlying dimensions are greater than the keywords specified,
the spacing of the highest dimension given is extended to the other dimensions. 
For example, if an image is being read from a file and only `dx=3.5` is given
gnuplot uses a delta x and delta y of 3.5.

   <p>The following keywords also apply only when generating coordinates.  However
they may also be used with matrix binary files.

<p class="noindent">&mdash; FLIPX, FLIPY, FLIPZ &mdash;

<!-- ?binary keywords flipx -->
   <p>Sometimes the scanning directions in a binary datafile are not consistent with
that assumed by gnuplot.  These keywords can flip the scanning direction along
dimensions x, y, z.

<p class="noindent">&mdash; ORIGIN  &mdash;

<!-- ?binary keywords origin -->
   <p>When gnuplot generates coordinates based upon transposition and flip, it
attempts to always position the lower left point in the array at the origin,
i.e., the data lies in the first quadrant of a Cartesian system after transpose
and flip.

   <p>To position the array somewhere else on the graph, the <a href="origin.html#origin">origin</a> keyword directs
gnuplot to position the lower left point of the array at a point specified by a
tuple.  The tuple should be a double for `plot` and a triple for `splot`. 
For example, `origin=(100,100):(100,200)` is for two records in the file and
intended for plotting in two dimensions. A second example, `origin=(0,0,3.5)`,
is for plotting in three dimensions.

<p class="noindent">&mdash; CENTER &mdash;

<!-- ?binary keywords center -->
<!-- ?keywords center -->
   <p>Similar to <a href="origin.html#origin">origin</a>, this keyword will position the array such that its center
lies at the point given by the tuple.  For example, `center=(0,0)`.  Center
does not apply when the size of the array is `Inf`.

<p class="noindent">&mdash; ROTATE &mdash;

<!-- ?binary keywords rotate -->
<!-- ?keywords rotate -->
   <p>The transpose and flip commands provide some flexibility in generating and
orienting coordinates.  However, for full degrees of freedom, it is possible to
apply a rotational vector described by a rotational angle in two dimensions.

   <p>The `rotate` keyword applies to the two-dimensional plane, whether it be `plot`
or `splot`.  The rotation is done with respect to the positive angle of the
Cartesian plane.

   <p>The angle can be expressed in radians, radians as a multiple of pi, or degrees. 
For example, `rotate=1.5708`, `rotate=0.5pi` and `rotate=90deg` are equivalent.

   <p>If <a href="origin.html#origin">origin</a> is specified, the rotation is done about the lower left sample
point before translation.  Otherwise, the rotation is done about the array
`center`.

<p class="noindent">&mdash; PERPENDICULAR &mdash;

<!-- ?binary keywords perpendicular -->
   <p>For `splot`, the concept of a rotational vector is implemented by a triple
representing the vector to be oriented normal to the two-dimensional x-y plane. 
Naturally, the default is (0,0,1).  Thus specifying both rotate and
perpendicular together can orient data myriad ways in three-space.

   <p>The two-dimensional rotation is done first, followed by the three-dimensional
rotation.  That is, if R' is the rotational 2 x 2 matrix described by an angle,
and P is the 3 x 3 matrix projecting (0,0,1) to (xp,yp,zp), let R be
constructed from R' at the upper left sub-matrix, 1 at element 3,3 and zeros
elsewhere.  Then the matrix formula for translating data is v' = P R v, where v
is the 3 x 1 vector of data extracted from the data file.  In cases where the
data of the file is inherently not three-dimensional, logical rules are used to
place the data in three-space.  (E.g., usually setting the z-dimension value to
zero and placing 2D data in the x-y plane.)
