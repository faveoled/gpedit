<p>General binary data in which format information is not necessarily part of
the file can be read by giving further details about the file format at the
command line.  Although the syntax is slightly arcane to the casual user,
general binary is particularly useful for application programs using gnuplot
and sending large amounts of data.

   <p>Syntax:
<pre class="example">           plot '&lt;file_name&gt;' {binary &lt;binary list&gt;} ...
           splot '&lt;file_name&gt;' {binary &lt;binary list&gt;} ...
     
</pre>
   <p>General binary format is activated by keywords in &lt;binary list&gt; pertaining
to information about file structure, i.e., <a href="array.html#array">array</a>, <a href="record.html#record">record</a>, `format` or
<a href="filetype.html#filetype">filetype</a>.  Otherwise, matrix binary format is assumed.  (See <a href="matrix.html#matrix">matrix</a>
for more details.)

   <p>There are some standard file types that may be read for which details about
the binary format may be extracted automatically.  (Type <a href="binary.html#binary">binary</a> at the command line for a list.)  Otherwise, details must be
specified at the command line or set in the defaults.  Keywords are described
below.

   <p>The keyword <a href="filetype.html#filetype">filetype</a> in &lt;binary list&gt; controls the routine used to
read the file, i.e., the format of the data.  For a list of the supported
file types, type `show datafile binary filetypes`.  If no file type is
given, the rule is that traditional gnuplot binary is assumed for `splot`
if the <a href="binary.html#binary">binary</a> keyword stands alone.  In all other circumstances, for
`plot` or when one of the &lt;binary list&gt; keywords appears, a raw binary
file is assumed whereby the keywords specify the binary format.

   <p>General binary data files fall into two basic classes, and some files may
be of both classes depending upon how they are treated.  There is that
class for which uniform sampling is assumed and point coordinates must be
generated.  This is the class for which full control via the &lt;binary
list&gt; keywords applies.  For this class, the settings precedence is that
command line parameters override in-file parameters, which override
default settings.  The other class is that set of files for which
coordinate information is contained within the file or there is possibly
a non-uniform sampling such as gnuplot binary.

   <p>Other than for the unique data files such as gnuplot binary, one should
think of binary data as conceptually the same as ASCII data.  Each point
has columns of information which are selected via the `&lt;using list&gt;`
associated with <a href="using.html#using">using</a>.  When no `format` string is specified, gnuplot
will retrieve a number of binary variables equal to the largest column
given in the `&lt;using list&gt;`.  For example, `using 1:3` will result in
three columns being read, of which the second will be ignored.  There are
default using lists based upon the typical number of parameters associated
with a certain plot type.  For example, `with image` has a default of
`using 1`, while <a href="rgbimage.html#rgbimage">rgbimage</a> has a default of `using 1:2:3`.  Note
that the special characters for <a href="using.html#using">using</a> representing point/line/index
generally should not be used for binary data.  There are keywords in
&lt;binary list&gt; that control this.
