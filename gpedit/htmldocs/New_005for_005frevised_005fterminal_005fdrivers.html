<h4 class="subsection">1.4.8 New or revised terminal drivers</h4>

<p>The `qt` driver implements an interactive terminal on top of the Qt
graphics layer.  It can function either as a window in a full-featured
desktop enviroment or as a full-screen application on a Qt-based
embedded device.  The `qt` terminal is new and may still have some
rough edges.

   <p>Two terminal types support web-based interactive display. The HTML5 `canvas`
terminal was introduced in version 4.4. The `svg` terminal has been extensively
revised to include support for mousing and better incorporation of svg plots
from gnuplot into larger svg/xml documents.

   <p>The `canvas` terminal driver produces javascript output that draws onto the
HTML canvas element of a web page.  It can produce either a complete web page
containing a single plot, or a script that can be embedded as part of an
externally generated HTML document that perhaps contains multiple plots. 
The embedded plots support browser-side mousing, including zoom/unzoom.

   <p>The `lua` terminal driver creates data intended to be further processed
by a script in the lua programming language.  At this point only one such
lua script, gnuplot-tikz.lua, is available.  It produces a TeX document
suitable for use with the latex TikZ package.  Other lua scripts could be
written to process the gnuplot output for use with other TeX packages,
or with other non-TeX tools.

   <p>`set term tikz` is shorthand for `set term lua tikz`.  As decribed above, it
uses the generic lua terminal and an external lua script to produce a latex
document.

   <p>The `context` terminal driver creates output to be further processed by
the ConTeXt TeX macro package. To process its output, you additionally require
the gnuplot module for ConTeXt available at
<a href="http://ctan.org/pkg/context-gnuplot">http://ctan.org/pkg/context-gnuplot</a>

   <p>The `epscairo` terminal uses the cairo and pango libraries to create
encapsulated postscript (eps) ouput. It is an alternative to the `postscript`
terminal driver for those who would like to have their eps files look equal
to e.g. screen output by the `wxt` terminal.

   <p>The `cairolatex` terminal uses the cairo backend of the `pdfcairo` or
`epscairo` terminal to produce graphs for inclusion in LaTeX documents. It
creates pdf or eps graphics but transfers texts to LaTeX in the same way as
the `epslatex` terminal.

   <p>The `windows` terminal driver has been revised to suport transparency,
antialiasing, buffered output, multiple graph windows and copying to clipboard
and saving of graphs as emf files. It has many new options and a revised user
interface. Additionaly, the code of the text console has been largely rewritten
to support wrapping of long lines. Help is now provided via HTML.
